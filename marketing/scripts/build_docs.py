<h2>Install and open</h2>
<p>iso.me is a free download on the App Store. There is no account to create and nothing to sign up for — the first thing you see is a five-step introduction.</p>

<h2>The onboarding steps</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Welcome</strong> — a short overview of what iso.me records and where it keeps it.</li>
<li><strong>Core features</strong> — visit timeline, route recording, and exports at a glance.</li>
<li><strong>Permission setup</strong> — iso.me asks for <em>While Using</em> location access first, then offers <em>Always</em>. <strong>Always</strong> is what enables automatic visit detection while the app is in the background; you can decline and still use manual tracking. If permission is denied, the app links you straight to iOS Settings.</li>
<li><strong>Connect Photos (optional)</strong> — you can enable photo moments now or skip entirely. Skipping changes nothing else.</li>
<li><strong>You're all set</strong> — optionally tick <em>Start tracking immediately</em> and iso.me begins recording the moment onboarding finishes.</li>
</ol>

<h2>After onboarding</h2>
<p>You land on the <strong>Map</strong> tab. The other tabs are <strong>Timeline</strong> (your day, visit by visit), <strong>Export</strong>, and <strong>Settings</strong>. The floating pill on the map starts and stops route recording; visits are detected automatically whenever <em>Always</em> location permission is granted and tracking is on.</p>

<h2>Your first day</h2>
<ul>
<li>Start tracking from the map pill before a walk or drive — you'll see the path draw in, and a Live Activity appears on your lock screen.</li>
<li>Stop tracking from the pill, the Live Activity's Stop button, Siri, or automatically with the auto-stop timer.</li>
<li>Open the Timeline tab to review where you went, how long you stayed, and how far you moved.</li>
</ul>

<div class="callout"><p><strong>Where is my data?</strong> On your iPhone only. See the <a href="/docs/privacy-data">Privacy &amp; your data</a> guide for the complete picture of storage, network requests, and deletion.</p></div>

<h2>Replay the intro</h2>
<p>Settings → <em>Replay onboarding</em> shows the introduction again at any time.</p>
"""

BODIES["tracking"] = """
<h2>Two kinds of history</h2>
<p>iso.me records <strong>visits</strong> (places you arrive at and depart from — automatic) and <strong>routes</strong> (continuous GPS paths — recorded while tracking is on). Both run from a single Start button.</p>

<h2>Starting and stopping</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Map pill</strong> — the floating control on the Map tab shows live duration and distance while recording.</li>
<li><strong>Live Activity</strong> — lock screen and Dynamic Island show progress and include a Stop button.</li>
<li><strong>Siri / Shortcuts</strong> — “Start iso.me” and “Stop tracking with iso.me” phrases work hands-free.</li>
<li><strong>Auto-stop timer</strong> — optional safety net that ends tracking automatically.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tracking state survives relaunches: if iso.me was recording when you last used your phone, it resumes when you open it again. If iOS relaunches the app in the background for a location event, recording continues without you touching anything.</p>

<h2>Visit detection</h2>
<p>Visits use iOS visit monitoring plus significant-location-change triggers. When you arrive somewhere, iso.me creates a visit; when you leave, it closes it. Behind the scenes iso.me also merges duplicate detections of the same stop (within roughly 100 meters and half an hour) and closes any visit left open when a new arrival makes it clearly stale — so you don't accumulate phantom “current” pins.</p>
<p>New visits are reverse-geocoded to a name and address automatically, unless you've turned <strong>Settings → Location tracking → Location names</strong> off (this toggle controls whether coordinates are sent to Apple's geocoding service).</p>

<h2>Route recording quality</h2>
<ul>
<li>Only fixes with reported accuracy of 100 m or better are saved; wilder fixes are dropped.</li>
<li>Obvious glitches — impossible jumps and out-and-back spikes — are flagged as <em>GPS glitches</em> and excluded from distances and maps by default. Enable <strong>Settings → Map display → Show GPS glitches</strong> to see them.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tracking settings reference</h2>
<table>
<tr><th>Setting</th><th>Options</th><th>Default</th><th>What it does</th></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Distance filter</strong></td><td>5 / 10 / 25 / 50 / 100 / 200 m</td><td>5 m</td><td>How far you must move before a new route point is recorded. Higher values save battery and shrink files.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Stop after</strong></td><td>Never / 1 / 2 / 4 / 8 / 12 h</td><td>Never</td><td>Automatically ends tracking after this long, so a forgotten session can't run all day.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Location names</strong></td><td>On / Off</td><td>On</td><td>Whether coordinates are sent to Apple's geocoding service to name visits.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Live Activity</strong></td><td>On / Off</td><td>On</td><td>Lock screen / Dynamic Island status while tracking.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Units</strong></td><td>Metric / US</td><td>Metric</td><td>Applies everywhere: app, widgets, Live Activity, watch.</td></tr>
</table>

<div class="callout"><p><strong>Battery.</strong> High-accuracy route recording uses real GPS and costs real battery — that's why it's a deliberate Start/Stop action rather than always-on. Visit detection alone is comparatively light. For long days, consider a 25–50 m distance filter and the auto-stop timer.</p></div>
"""

BODIES["timeline-outings"] = """
<h2>The day view</h2>
<p>The <strong>Timeline</strong> tab shows one day at a time: visits and movement sessions interleaved in order, with a day summary of moves, visits, and total distance. Step through days with the arrows, jump straight to Today, or pick any date. If today is empty, iso.me automatically opens your most recent day with data.</p>

<h2>Recorded vs inferred outings</h2>
<p>A movement session (<em>outing</em>) is <strong>recorded</strong> when you pressed Start, and <strong>inferred</strong> when iso.me notices a stretch of GPS points that clearly forms a trip — including older data recorded before outings existed, or imported from your Watch. Inferred outings wear an <code>INFERRED</code> badge; the live one wears <code>LIVE</code>.</p>
<p>Inference is configurable in <strong>Settings → Inferred outings</strong>:</p>
<table>
<tr><th>Setting</th><th>Options</th><th>Default</th></tr>
<tr><td>Auto-generate</td><td>On / Off</td><td>On</td></tr>
<tr><td>Split after (quiet gap)</td><td>15 m / 30 m / 1 h / 2 h / 4 h</td><td>30 minutes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ignore shorter than</td><td>None / 5 m / 15 m / 30 m / 1 h</td><td>None</td></tr>
<tr><td>Minimum GPS points</td><td>1 / 2 / 3 / 5 / 10</td><td>1</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Outing detail</h2>
<p>Tap any outing for its full record: a road-matched mini map, start and end times, duration, distance, point count, GPS-glitch count, and average speed. Recorded outings can be renamed and given notes (inferred ones can't — edit the points' day instead). Linked visits and photos appear below.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Show on map</strong> focuses the Map tab on this outing's path.</li>
<li><strong>Export</strong> saves this single outing in your choice of format (a Pro feature; the picker remembers your format).</li>
<li><strong>Delete outing</strong> removes the session and its GPS points — <strong>visits are kept</strong>. Deleting the active outing stops tracking first.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Route replay</h2>
<p>Both the map (for a whole day) and the outing detail page (for one outing) offer <strong>replay</strong>: a playhead walks the path in order while a scrubber, elapsed time, and running distance update. It's a quick way to answer “where was I around 3 pm?”</p>

<h2>Sorting</h2>
<p>Outing lists can be sorted by newest, oldest, longest duration, distance, or point count.</p>
"""

BODIES["places"] = """
<h2>The visit lifecycle</h2>
<p>Every visit carries a status: <strong>unconfirmed</strong> (as detected), <strong>confirmed</strong> (you approved it), or <strong>corrected</strong> (you changed the name, address, or location). iso.me never lets automatic geocoding overwrite a visit you've touched — your edits are final until you undo them.</p>

<h2>Confirming and correcting</h2>
<ul>
<li>Tap a visit on the map or in the timeline to open its detail sheet, then <strong>Confirm place</strong> to accept the detected name.</li>
<li>To fix a wrong name, edit it or pick from <strong>nearby business suggestions</strong> — real places found via Apple Maps around the visit's location, searchable in the sheet.</li>
<li><strong>Undo correction</strong> restores the originally detected name, address, and position.</li>
<li>Arrival and departure times are editable (with a “still here” toggle for ongoing visits), and notes can be attached to any visit.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Saved places</h2>
<p>Confirming or correcting a visit also <strong>saves the place</strong> — a name, position, and a match radius (default 150 m). From then on, any new visit inside that radius is automatically named from the saved place and marked confirmed. No more re-correcting “Home” every week.</p>
<ul>
<li>Saved places are manageable from the manual-entry sheet: select, swipe to delete, or create new ones with a radius of 50 / 100 / 150 / 250 m.</li>
<li>Places with the same name at nearly the same spot update each other instead of piling up.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Manual and past visits</h2>
<p>The <strong>+</strong> menu on the map offers three ways to add history by hand:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Save current place</strong> — names where you are right now.</li>
<li><strong>Add past visit</strong> — pick a place, an arrival, and a departure; the map then jumps to that day so you can see it in context.</li>
<li><strong>Add place manually</strong> — search Apple Maps, drop a pin, pick a saved place, or use your current location; optionally save it as a reusable place.</li>
</ul>
<p>Locations can be chosen by searching Apple Maps, dropping a pin on a map, reusing a saved place, or using your current GPS position. Past visits require a departure time and never silently fall back to “here”.</p>

<h2>The current-place suggestion</h2>
<p>With <strong>Settings → Map display → Visit suggestions</strong> enabled (off by default), the map can offer a small card when you arrive somewhere new — suggesting the nearest saved place or a nearby business, with one tap to save. Dismissing a suggestion also silences it for that spot, so it doesn't nag.</p>
"""

BODIES["photos"] = """
<h2>What it does</h2>
<p>With photo moments enabled, iso.me can show geotagged photos from your library as markers on the map — clustered when they're close together — and attach them to the outings and visits they belong to. It's an entirely optional layer: off until you turn it on.</p>

<h2>How photos are placed</h2>
<p>Each photo is matched to a location using the first source that works:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The photo's own GPS</strong> — geotagged photos are placed exactly where they were taken.</li>
<li><strong>Your route</strong> — otherwise iso.me looks for the nearest recorded GPS point within about 15 minutes of the capture time.</li>
<li><strong>A visit</strong> — otherwise, if the capture time falls inside a visit (with a little grace), the photo attaches to that place.</li>
</ol>
<p>Photos that match none of these are simply skipped.</p>

<h2>Privacy mechanics</h2>
<div class="callout"><p><strong>Photo files never leave your Photos library.</strong> iso.me stores only each photo's local identifier and match metadata on-device. Nothing is uploaded, and limited-access mode is fully supported — only the photos you've selected for iso.me will appear.</p></div>

<h2>Controls</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automatic syncing</strong> (off by default) re-scans your library in the background, at most every 10 minutes, and re-syncs whenever your library changes.</li>
<li><strong>Map markers</strong> (off by default) — enable from the map's filter bar or Settings; nearby photos group into stacked clusters with a count badge.</li>
<li><strong>Thumbnails on markers</strong> can be turned off if you prefer plain pins.</li>
<li>Tap any marker for a quick view, or open it full-screen to swipe through the day's photos.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a photo disappears from your library (with full access), iso.me cleans up its record automatically.</p>
"""

BODIES["export-import"] = """
<div class="callout pro"><p><strong>Free vs Pro.</strong> Building and previewing exports is free. Writing export files (from the app's Export tab or an outing's page) is the Pro unlock, along with automatic exports and webhooks. <strong>Importing a prior export is free.</strong></p></div>

<h2>Eight formats</h2>
<table>
<tr><th>Format</th><th>Best for</th></tr>
<tr><td><strong>JSON</strong></td><td>Lossless backups, scripts, and tooling.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>CSV</strong></td><td>Spreadsheets and analysis.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Markdown</strong></td><td>Human-readable journals — single outings export as a front-matter page with visits and route points.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>GeoJSON</strong></td><td>Mapping tools and GIS.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>GPX</strong></td><td>GPS tools and route viewers; visits become waypoints, routes become tracks.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>KML</strong></td><td>Google Earth and Earth-compatible viewers.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>OwnTracks</strong></td><td>OwnTracks-ecosystem tools (route points).</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Overland</strong></td><td>Overland-ecosystem tools (route points).</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Choose any mix of formats in one export; each becomes its own file. OwnTracks and Overland formats carry route points (visits exports in those slots fall back to JSON).</p>

<h2>What gets exported</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data</strong>: visits, route points, outings, or all of it.</li>
<li><strong>Date range</strong>: all time (default), today, yesterday, last 7 or 30 days, this month, or a custom range.</li>
<li><strong>Time of day</strong> (off by default): keep only records between two times — windows that cross midnight work too.</li>
<li><strong>Filters</strong>: only completed visits, minimum visit duration, exclude GPS glitches, and a maximum-accuracy cap (≤ 10 / 25 / 50 / 100 m).</li>
<li><strong>Fields</strong>: per-format toggles for names, addresses, durations, coordinates, notes, altitude, speed, accuracy, and glitch flags.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your entire setup — formats, data kind, filters, field toggles — is remembered between launches.</p>

<h2>Filename templates</h2>
<p>File names come from a template you control. These tokens are available:</p>
<p><code>{date}</code> <code>{year}</code> <code>{month}</code> <code>{dayNumber}</code> <code>{weekday}</code> <code>{monthName}</code> <code>{quarter}</code> <code>{datetime}</code> <code>{time}</code> <code>{day}</code> <code>{type}</code> <code>{title}</code> <code>{name}</code> <code>{format}</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Use <code>/</code> in a template to build dated subfolders.</li>
<li>Built-in presets: <em>Readable</em> (default) <code>iso.me - {day} {date} - {type}</code>, <em>Compact</em>, and <em>Dated</em> <code>{year}/{year}-{month}/Daily Track - {date}</code>.</li>
<li>A live preview shows the resolved path as you type.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Output layout</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Single file</strong> (default) or <strong>one file per day</strong> — handy for journals and incremental backups.</li>
<li>Exporting <em>outings</em> produces one file per outing automatically.</li>
<li>Collisions are auto-suffixed so nothing overwrites.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Saving and sharing</h2>
<p>Pick a <strong>default folder</strong> (with auto-save on by default) and exports land there silently with a confirmation toast; otherwise the standard share sheet appears. The <strong>Preview</strong> button renders everything without writing — free, and a good way to sanity-check filters. Single outings can also be exported straight from their detail page.</p>

<h2>Import</h2>
<p>Settings → <strong>Import file</strong> restores a prior export. JSON, CSV, and Markdown round-trip fully, including correction history and glitch flags. GPX, KML, and GeoJSON are one-way <em>map</em> formats and can't be imported. Importing is free.</p>
"""

BODIES["automatic-exports"] = """
<div class="callout pro"><p><strong>Pro feature.</strong> Auto Export appears in the Export tab once you've chosen a default export folder and unlocked Pro.</p></div>

<h2>The idea</h2>
<p>You pick a folder, a format, and a schedule. Each run exports <strong>the current local day so far</strong> into <strong>one file for that day</strong> — always the same file name for the same day, no matter how many times it runs. Yesterday's file is never touched; tomorrow gets a new one.</p>

<h2>Schedules</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Once daily</strong> — at a time you choose (default 21:00).</li>
<li><strong>Every 1–23 hours</strong> — from a start time you choose. A 3-hour schedule starting at 09:00 fires at 09:00, 12:00, 15:00…; intervals that don't divide the day simply restart from the next day's start time.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Rewrite vs append</h2>
<table>
<tr><th>Mode</th><th>Behavior</th></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Rewrite</strong> (default)</td><td>Each run rewrites the day's file with everything recorded so far today. Simple and self-healing.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Append</strong></td><td>Each run adds only records captured since the last successful run — no duplicates, tiny writes. (Once-daily schedules always rewrite.)</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Append works for CSV, JSON, Markdown, OwnTracks, Overland, and GeoJSON. GPX and KML always rewrite the full day, because valid XML files can't be naively concatenated.</p>

<h2>How the app wakes up</h2>
<p>iOS never guarantees background execution, so Auto Export layers its chances:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Background refresh</strong> — iOS schedules the app to wake near each run.</li>
<li><strong>A silent push</strong> — iso.me's scheduling service nudges the app at the fire time. The service only ever holds timing metadata (your time zone, the schedule, a push token) — never location records, file contents, or folder names.</li>
<li><strong>A fallback notification</strong> — if nothing ran by a minute after the scheduled time, you get a tappable “Daily Export Ready” notification; tapping runs it.</li>
<li><strong>Catch-up</strong> — opening the app runs any overdue occurrence automatically.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a run fails you'll get a notification with the reason and a retry; the schedule itself keeps going.</p>

<h2>Manual control</h2>
<p><strong>Run now</strong> in the Auto Export section performs an export immediately regardless of schedule — useful after a big day. The section also shows the last run time and format.</p>
"""

BODIES["webhooks"] = """
<div class="callout pro"><p><strong>Pro feature, off by default.</strong> Webhooks can send your location data off your device — to a server <em>you</em> choose. Nothing is sent until you configure an endpoint, and the settings screen leads with a prominent warning card.</p></div>

<h2>What it's for</h2>
<p>If you run your own location infrastructure — <a href="https://dawarich.app" rel="noopener">Dawarich</a>, an OwnTracks recorder, Traccar, or anything that accepts HTTP posts — webhooks turn iso.me into a source for it. Known-good endpoint patterns:</p>

<li><strong>Endpoint</strong> — the URL to POST to.</li>
<li><strong>Format</strong> — JSON, CSV, Markdown, GeoJSON, GPX, KML, OwnTracks, or Overland.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication</strong> — none, API key in the query string, Bearer token, Basic auth, or a custom header. Credentials live in the iOS <strong>Keychain</strong>, never in plain preferences, and error messages mask them.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Send modes</h2>
<table>
<tr><th>Mode</th><th>Behavior</th></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Real-time</strong> (default)</td><td>Each newly recorded point is sent as it's saved. On launch the sender “arms” itself first, so enabling webhooks never bulk-dumps your history.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>By count</strong></td><td>Points queue and flush every 5 / 10 / 25 / 50 / 100 points.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>By time</strong></td><td>Queued points flush every 1–60 minutes.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Manual</strong></td><td>Nothing sends automatically; <strong>Send now</strong> posts your entire saved history (visits and points).</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Batch modes show a live queue count with a <strong>Flush queue</strong> button. Failed sends retry automatically with backoff on network errors and server hiccups (5xx, timeouts, rate limits); authentication failures don't retry — they surface as an error. <strong>Test connection</strong> posts a single harmless sample point so you can verify an endpoint before committing.</p>

<div class="callout warn"><p><strong>Know your destination.</strong> This is the one feature that transmits your location data off-device.

"""

BODIES["apple-watch"] = """
<h2>An independent recorder</h2>
<p>The iso.me Watch app isn't a remote control — it's a full tracker with its own GPS session. It installs and runs on its own (no iPhone required nearby), records routes with fitness-grade accuracy, and queues everything <strong>offline</strong> until it can sync.</p>

<h2>On the watch</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Start / Stop</strong> — one button; permission is requested on first start.</li>
<li><strong>Status card</strong> — live elapsed timer (plus remaining auto-stop time when one is set from the phone).</li>
<li><strong>Today card</strong> — visits, distance, and points recorded today, with a <strong>Reset today</strong> button for a fresh start.</li>
<li><strong>Location card</strong> — current coordinates and last update time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Watch-recorded distance uses sensible heuristics: fixes must be accurate (≤ 100 m), movement under 10 m doesn't accumulate, and a new “visit” is counted after about 100 m of displacement. Day counters roll over automatically at local midnight.</p>

<h2>Sync back to the iPhone</h2>
<p>Recorded points are queued durably on the watch and transferred automatically — every 25 points, at session start and end, and whenever the phone is reachable — then merged into your iPhone history. The merge is idempotent: re-syncing never duplicates anything, and the phone reverse-geocodes the imported visits so they get proper names. Recording works fully offline; sync catches up whenever it can.</p>

<h2>Photos</h2>
<p>The photo feature reads your library on-device to match pictures to places. Photo files are never copied or uploaded; iso.me keeps only local identifiers and match metadata, and respects limited-access mode.</p>

<h2>Deleting your data</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Everything, in-app:</strong> Settings → Data → <strong>Clear all data</strong> permanently removes every visit, point, outing, photo match, and saved place.</li>
<li><strong>Everything, bluntly:</strong> deleting the app removes your entire journal and the local analytics install ID from that device.</li>
<li><strong>Single items:</strong> delete any visit or outing from its detail page.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Backups are your job (by design)</h2>
<p>Because nothing is synced to a cloud, there is no server copy to fall back on. Export regularly — JSON round-trips losslessly through import, and Auto Export can do it for you every day. See <a href="/docs/export-import">Export &amp; import</a>.</p>

<h2>Permissions iso.me requests</h2>
<table>
<tr><th>Permission</th><th>Why</th></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Location — Always</strong></td><td>Automatic visit detection in the background (While-Using still works for manual sessions).</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Photos</strong> (optional)</td><td>Matching your pictures to places; never modifies your library.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Notifications</strong> (optional)</td><td>Auto Export status and retry notices.</td></tr>
